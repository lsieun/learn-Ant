# Ant Vs Maven

**Apache Maven** is by far the most popular build manager for Java projects which combines **build manager** with **dependency manager**. Maven follows **Custom over Configuration** approach, which means your project has to fall into certain customs or best practices dictated by Maven with less flexibility over configuration. It is the default choice for the developers who donâ€™t mind adapting to certain customs. Maven also comes with other features like project information reports etc., to cover all aspects of a good build process.

Another equally popular build system is **Apache Ant**, which follows **Configuration over Custom** approach. Developers who like to configure the build system from scratch and wants a flexible build process prefer Ant over Maven. When you work with Ant, **Apache Ivy** is a good choice for **automated dependency management**.

**Apache Ivy** is a **dependency manager** from Apache and it gels perfectly with Apache Ant to automate dependency management to improve overall build system.
