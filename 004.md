**Ant types** are **the placeholders** for the information that **Ant tasks** require, and you specify them using nested XML elements.

## 1. Using Directory-Based Types

### 1.1. Using Pattern Sets

Wildcard Characters Used in Ant Patterns

| Character | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `?`       | Matches a single character and a single character only.      |
| `*`       | Matches zero or more characters.                             |
| `**`      | Matches zero or more directories if used as a directory name in a pattern. Matches any file if used as a filename in a pattern. |

Ant processes all the `includes` first and then applies the `excludes` to this list. Therefore, `excludes` always take precedence. One common error is to exclude everything and then include only the files you want by placing the include pattern after the exclude pattern like so:

```xml
<patternset excludes="**" includes="*.java"/>
```

Here’s an example of these nested elements:

```xml
<patternset id="src.files">
    <include name="${src}/**"/>
    <include name="build.*"/>
</patternset>
```

### 1.2. Working with Default Excludes

Ant will exclude a number of file and directory types by default.

The default exclude patterns are as follows:

```txt
**/*~
**/#*#
**/.#*
**/%*%
**/._*
**/CVS
**/CVS/**
**/.cvsignore
**/SCCS
**/SCCS/**
**/vssver.scc
**/.svn
**/.svn/**
**/.DS_Store
```

Pattern Sets Demonstration, Contrasting the `*` and `**` Patterns

```xml
<patternset id="pattern.id.one.star">
    <include name="lib/*"/>
</patternset>

<patternset id="pattern.id.two.star">
    <include name="lib/**"/>
</patternset>
```

## 2. Working with Directory Sets

You specify a directory set with the `<dirset>` element, which either you can place as a child element of `<project>` and give **an ID**, or you can use as a child element of **a task**.

When you specify a `<dirset>` element, whether as a child element of `<project>` or as a child element of an appropriate task, it takes the `<exclude>`, `<excludesfile>`, `<include>`, and `<includesfile>` child elements and the `excludes`, `excludesfile`, `includes`, and `includesfile` attributes just as if it were a pattern set.

The Same Directory Set Using First an Explicit Pattern Set, Followed by an Implicit Pattern Set

```xml
<dirset dir="." id="explicit">
    <patternset>
        <include name="lib/**"/>
    </patternset>
</dirset>

<dirset dir="." id="implicit">
    <include name="lib/**"/>
</dirset>
```

You can then reuse these directory sets in other directory sets within your build file, just as shown here:

```xml
<dirset refid="explicit"/>
<dirset refid="implicit"/>
```

## 3. Working with File Sets

You specify a file set using the `<fileset>` element, which either you can place as a child element of `<project>` and give **an ID** or you can use as a child element of **a task**.

When you specify a `<fileset>` element, whether as a child element of `<project>` or as a child element of **an appropriate task**, it takes the `<exclude>`, `<excludesfile>`, `<include>`, and `<includesfile>` child elements and the `excludes`, `excludesfile`, `includes`, and `includesfile` attributes just as if it were a pattern set.

A File Set That Turns Off the Default Excludes

```xml
<fileset dir="." defaultexcludes="no">
    <include name="lib/java/*.java?"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.1. Using Selectors

Selectors are Ant’s mechanism for selecting files and directories using criteria other than filenames. To specify a selector, you place it inside **a selector container**. The `<fileset>` element is **a special selector container** in that it can contain any number of **other selector containers** except another `<fileset>` element.

If you want to configure a projectwide selector for reuse, you can specify a `<selector>` element as a child element of `<project>`. **This selector container** can contain **only one selector**, which may be **another container**, and you must give it **an ID** so that you can reference it later in the project build.

```xml
<fileset dir=".">
    <selector if="two.stars">
        <filename name="lib/**"/>
    </selector>
</fileset>
```

### 3.2. Using the Contains Selector

The `<contains>` selector includes only those files that contain the text specified by the `text` attribute.

Here’s an example that includes all the source files for a project, but only if they are covered by the Apache License:

```xml
<fileset id="javadoc" dir="${src}">
    <include name="shared/**"/>
    <include name="stand-alone/**"/>
    <include name="web/java/**"/>
    <contains text="Licensed under the Apache License"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.3. Using the Date Selector

The `<date>` selector allows you to select files that were last modified during a specified time period. This time period can be a period before the specified date/time, a period after the specified date/time, or an exact match of the specified date/time.

The following example includes all the HTML documentation of a project, but only if it is older than the date, which is specified in British format:

```xml
<fileset dir="${src.shared}/docs">
    <include name="*.html"/>
    <date datetime="01/02/2005" pattern="DD/MM/YYYY"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.4. Using the Depend Selector

The `<depend>` selector selects files only if they have been modified after their namesakes in another location. This allows you to select only those files that have been updated in a new release of a project, for example.

To use this selector, you specify a file set as normal and then use the `targetdir` attribute to tell Ant the location of the older distribution that it should compare with.

```xml
<fileset id="javadoc" dir="${src}">
    <exclude name="*/conf/**"/>
    <exclude name="*/docs/*"/>
    <include name="shared/**"/>
    <include name="stand-alone/**"/>
    <include name="web/java/**"/>
    <depend targetdir="${docs}/api"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.5. Using the Depth Selector

The `<depth>` selector lets you choose files from a portion of the project’s directory hierarchy, depending on the depth of nesting.

Here’s an example that includes files only from the number of directories specified by the user at the command line:

```xml
<fileset dir="${docs.all.dir}">
    <patternset refid="docs.all"/>
    <depth max="${user.depth}"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.6. Using the Different Selector

The `<different>` selector selects files only if they are different from their namesakes in another location.

The following uses all the documentation in a project, but only if it is different from the existing built Javadocs:

```xml
<fileset dir="${docs.all.dir}">
    <patternset refid="docs.all"/>
    <different targetdir="${docs}/api" ignoreFileTimes="false"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.7. Using the Filename Selector

The `<filename>` selector is an include/exclude mechanism; however, unlike the `<include>` and `<exclude>` tags of pattern set fame, you can combine it with other selectors using selector containers. In other words, the `<filename>` selector selects files based on a pattern.

The following two file sets match the opposite files from each other:

```xml
<fileset dir="${build}/build-mysql-jdbc">
    <filename name="mysql-connector*/*.jar" negate="true"/>
</fileset>

<fileset dir="${build}/build-mysql-jdbc">
    <include name="mysql-connector*/*.jar"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.8. Using the Present Selector

The `<present>` selector selects files that have a namesake (or not, depending on the setting) in a target directory, and for this reason it is case-sensitive.

The following uses all the documentation in a project, but only if corresponding built Javadocs aren’t present in `${docs}/api`:

```xml
<fileset dir="${docs.all.dir}">
    <patternset refid="docs.all"/>
    <present targetdir="${docs}/api" present="srconly"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.9. Using the Containsregexp Selector

The `<containsregexp>` selector selects only those files that contain text matching a specified regular expression.

Here’s an example that includes all the source files for a project, but only if they are covered by the Apache License (though we are taking British spelling into account just in case):

```xml
<fileset id="javadoc" dir="${src}">
    <include name="shared/**"/>
    <include name="stand-alone/**"/>
    <include name="web/java/**"/>
    <containsregexp expression="Licensed under the Apache Licen[sc]e"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.10. Using the Size Selector

The `<size>` selector places a limit on file size.

Here you select only certain JAR files and only if they are smaller than 1 gigabyte:

```xml
<fileset dir="${httpunit.home}/jars">
    <include name="*.jar"/>
    <exclude name="junit.jar"/>
    <size value="1" units="Gi" when="less"/>
</fileset>
```

### 3.11. Using the Type Selector

The `<type>` selector allows you to select either files or directories, excluding the other type.

### 3.12. Using the Modified Selector

The `<modified>` selector is a much more complicated selector than the others already described, mainly because it gives you so many options and is so flexible. In essence, it uses a hash from a previous version, which it stores in a cache, and a hash of the current file to see if it has been altered.

For example, if you want to use SHA and store the cache in a nondefault file, you could use the following:

```xml
<modified>
    <param name="cache.cachefile" value="custom.properties"/>
    <param name="algorithm.algorithm" value="SHA"/>
</modified>
```

### 3.13. Using Selector Containers

So, to return to the `<type>` selector, the following example includes only files in the `${src.web}/pages` directory that have been modified:

```xml
<fileset dir="${src.web}/pages">
    <and>
        <modified>
            <param name="cache.cachefile" value="custom.properties"/>
            <param name="algorithm.algorithm" value="SHA"/>
        </modified>
        <type type="file"/>
    </and>
</fileset>
```

Now this example will include all files that are covered by the Apache License or the GPL:

```xml
<fileset id="javadoc" dir="${src}">
    <include name="shared/**"/>
    <include name="stand-alone/**"/>
    <include name="web/java/**"/>
    <or>
        <containsregexp expression="Licensed under the Apache Licen[sc]e"/>
        <containsregexp expression="GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICEN[SC]E"/>
    </or>
</fileset>
```

Of course, you may not want to include any open-source files at all.

```xml
<fileset id="javadoc" dir="${src}">
    <include name="shared/**"/>
    <include name="stand-alone/**"/>
    <include name="web/java/**"/>

    <none>
        <containsregexp expression="Licensed under the Apache Licen[sc]e"/>
        <containsregexp expression="GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICEN[SC]E"/>
    </none>
</fileset>
```

## 4. Working with Class File Sets

## 5. Working with File Lists

File lists do not support **pattern matching**, so you must specify filenames. If you use a wildcard, you must use it literally.

You can nest a `<file>` element to specify a file. The following shows how you can use both approaches to include the same file:

```xml
<filelist dir="lib/java" files="One.java"/>

<filelist dir="lib/java">
    <file name="One.java"/>
</filelist>
```

## 6. Working with Zip File Sets

You can use the `<zipfileset>` element as a child element of the four tasks that create archives (`<zip>`, `<war>`, `<jar>`, and `<ear>`).
