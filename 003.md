Now that you have installed Ant, you are ready to start using it. However, Ant is nothing without its build files. You must provide Ant with a description of the project before you can start to build the project.

## 1. Running Ant from the Command Line

The usual method of running Ant is to use the `ant` shell script supplied in `ANT_HOME/bin`.

The `ant` script has a number of options at the command line. You can see what these are by running `ant -h`. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
ant [options] [target [target2 [target3] ...]]
```

The list of targets tells Ant which targets to execute in the build file.

## 2. Introducing Ant’s Build File Syntax

### 2.1. Examining the Project Element

The Minimum Requirements for a Build File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project>

</project>
```

Generating an Incomplete DTD

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project>
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</project>
```

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClientConfig

I was able to solve the problem by downloading commons-net-3.2-bin.tar.gz from http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/download_net.cgi and installing commons-net-3.2.jar into my /usr/local/ant/lib folder.

According to https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/ftp.html, you need to install Apache Commons Net and Jakarta Oro.

Copy these jars to your `\lib` directory, as Jason Posit said.

All in all, you may find it more straightforward to not work with DTDs, and you’ll find that few source bundles come with DTD declarations.

Ant will always run any **tasks** that you set as child elements of `<project>`, which means every run of the project will include these tasks. If you want to control which tasks Ant runs, or you want to group related build steps (and you do), then you need to use **targets**, as defined by the `<target>` element. `<target>` elements are child elements of `<project>`, and you place tasks inside them so that you have more control over your builds. You can set a target as a default so that Ant will run it if you do not specify a target at the command line. To do so, use the `<project>` element’s `default` attribute.

You set the base directory of the current build with the `<project>` element’s `basedir` attribute. If you do not specify a default directory, the default is the parent directory of the `build.xml` file.

Lastly, you can give the project **a name**, which is useful as a description.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<target name="build-dtd">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

### 2.2. Examining the Target Element

A target is a collection of Ant tasks that you want to run as a unit. Each target should represent a discrete step of your build process and no more.

The `<target>` element is the XML representation of a target in the build file. As already mentioned, it is a child element of `<project>`. It also can contain as many task elements as are required. When Ant calls a target, each of these tasks runs in turn until they all complete or one fails. You can chain targets together so that one target will not execute until another has completed all its tasks successfully. By setting these dependencies, you can start to build a description of the build process.

The `<target>` element’s only mandatory attribute is `name`. The `name` allows you to call the target from the command line or from within the build file. You can accomplish the latter with the `<project>` element’s `default` attribute or with certain tasks.

You can provide the target with a description using the `description` attribute, and Ant uses this description when you call it with the `-projecthelp` option. In this case, Ant will display only the names and descriptions of targets that have descriptions. Ant is assuming that if it isn’t important enough to have a description, it isn’t important enough to be shown as a major target that you would want to run.<sub>注：这样一个假设，真是“有意思”</sub>

```bash
ant -projecthelp
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<target name="build-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

To run this target, execute the following in the same directory as the build file:

```bash
ant build-dtd
```

The `<description>` element adds a master description to a build file if you use it as a child element of `<project>`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<description>
    Apache Ant book example project. The main targets are listed below.
</description>

<target name="build-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

If you want Ant to always run one target before running another one, such as an initialization target before a compilation target, then you need to specify the name of the first target you want to run in the second target’s `depends` attribute.

```xml
<project name="Apache Ant Project" basedir="." default="build-dtd">

<target name="pre-dtd">
...
</target>

<target name="build-dtd" depends="pre-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

In this example, the `build-dtd` target depends on the `pre-dtd` target. Once `pre-dtd` finishes successfully, `build-dtd` runs any tasks that it contains.

You can set as many target names in `depends` as you want by separating each name with **a comma**. Ant works through them one at a time until they all succeed or one fails.



## 4. Using Properties to Control a Build

### 4.1. Using the Available Task

The `<available>` task sets the value of a property if a resource exists when you run the build process. The default value of the property is `true`, which is enough for the purposes of the `if` and `unless` attributes, which check to see whether a property is set. In other words, they don’t care what the value is.

Using the `<available>` Element to Check for the Existence of Third-Party Files

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Available Project" basedir="." default="build-jstl">

<property name="jstl.src" value="./src/jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="./lib/jstl.jar"/>

<available property="jstl.src.exists" file="${jstl.src}"/>
<available property="jstl.jar.exists" file="${jstl.jar}"/>

<target name="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.src.exists">
    <echo message="Checking out ${jstl.jar}"/>
    ...
</target>

<target name="build-jstl" depends="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.jar.exists">
    <echo message="Building ${jstl.jar}"/>
    ...
</target>

</project>
```

The following shows how to use the `filepath` attribute to replace the paths in the properties:

```xml
<property name="jstl.src" value="jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="jstl.jar"/>

<available property="jstl.src.exists" file="${jstl.src}" filepath="./src"/>
<available property="jstl.jar.exists" file="${jstl.jar}" filepath="./lib"/>
```

### 4.2. Using the Uptodate Task

Using a File Set As Part of an `<uptodate>` Check

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<uptodate property="uptodate" targetfile="./One.java">
    <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
</uptodate>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

Using a File Set and Mapper As Part of an `<uptodate>` Check

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<uptodate property="uptodate">
    <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
    <mapper type="merge" to="./One.java"/>
</uptodate>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

### 4.3. Using the Condition Task

Using the `<condition>` Task Instead of the `<available>` and `<uptodate>` Tasks

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<property name="jstl.src" value="jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="jstl.jar"/>

<condition property="jstl.src.exists">
    <available file="${jstl.src}" filepath="./src"/>
</condition>

<condition property="jstl.jar.exists">
    <available file="${jstl.jar}" filepath="./lib"/>
</condition>

<condition property="uptodate">
    <uptodate>
        <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
        <mapper type="merge" to="./One.java"/>
    </uptodate>
</condition>

<target name="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.src.exists">
    <echo message="Checking out ${jstl.jar}"/>
</target>

<target name="build-jstl" depends="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.jar.exists">
    <echo message="Building ${jstl.jar}"/>
</target>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.1. Using the `<os>` Test

If you are working with a project that needs to check the operating system on which it is built and carry out actions appropriately, then you can use the `<os>` nested element.

For `arch`, `name`, and `version`, Ant calls the appropriate line in the following and compares the value with that specified in the attribute:

```java
System.getProperty("os.arch");
System.getProperty("os.name");
System.getProperty("os.version");
```

Using the `<os>` Element’s family Attribute to Test the Operating System

```xml
<condition property="is.windows">
    <os family="windows"/>
</condition>

<condition property="is.unix">
    <os family="unix"/>
</condition>

<target name="do-windows" if="is.windows">
    <echo message="This is Windows"/>
</target>

<target name="do-unix" if="is.unix">
    <echo message="This is Unix"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.2. Using the `<equals>` Test

The `<equals>` nested element tests two strings to see if they are equal. This is a classic example of `if` functionality, and you can use it to check the values of properties or filenames.

#### 4.3.3. Using the `<isset>` Test

The `<isset>` element tests whether a property has been set in this project. You may find this test most useful when used in conjunction with other tests. For example, you may want to test to see whether a command-line property has been set and that a certain file exists and then run a target only if this is the case.

#### 4.3.4. Using the `<istrue>` and `<isfalse>` Tests

The `<istrue>` and `<isfalse>` tests are related to and extend the `<isset>` test, but check that the value of the property is `true` or `false`, respectively. Ant also considers `yes` and `on` to equal `true` and considers `no` and `off` to equal `false`, so these values also satisfy these tests.

#### 4.3.5. Using the `<isreference>` Test

The `<isreference>` test checks whether the given ID is indeed a valid reference. You can also check whether this ID refers to a certain type of Ant structure.

A File Set Reference Is Tested Using the `<isreference>` Test

```xml
<condition property="is.fileset">
    <isreference refid="uptodate.id" type="fileset"/>
</condition>

<target name="fileset-prepare">
    <echo message="Value of is.fileset = ${is.fileset}"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.6. Using the `<isfileselected>` Test

The `<isfileselected>` test succeeds if a given file matches all the conditions specified as nested selectors. Use it as you would a file set.

#### 4.3.7. Using the `<checksum>` Test

You use this test to check that a file matches the checksum supplied as part of a download.

#### 4.3.8. Using the `<http>` Test

The `<http>` test checks that a web server provides a valid response and sets the property if this is the case. This allows you to check whether a server is listening to requests before you begin a download from it.

#### 4.3.9. Using the `<socket>` Test

The `<socket>` test checks that a process is listening at the specified server and port. Again, you can use this to check that you can run a target that requires this to be the case.

#### 4.3.10. Using the `<filesmatch>` Test

The `<filesmatch>` test checks whether two files are identical.

#### 4.3.11. Using the `<contains>` Test

The `<contains>` attribute represents another classic if function: checking whether a string contains another string.

#### 4.3.12. Using the `<length>` Test

The `<length>` test checks the length of a string or a file. It is actually a task in its own right, but you can place it as a nested element of `<condition>` to use it as a test. This extends the functionality of the task in some ways, but reduces it in others.

#### 4.3.13. Using Logical Operators

The three logical operators are `<not>`, `<and>`, and `<or>`.

### 4.4. Working with Property Sets

## 5. Using Pathlike Structures

### 5.1. Setting a Pathlike Structure

A pathlike structure is a reusable collection of files or directories that has a unique ID so that whenever you want to use it, you supply its reference ID.

Another way you can use pathlike structures is when you want to perform multiple operations on the same group of files or directories.

Building Pathlike Structures

```xml
<property environment="env"/>

<path id="build.path.id">
    <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
</path>

<!-- A short-form version of the above -->
<path id="build.path.id" path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>

<path id="build.path.complete">
    <path refid="build.path.id"/>
    <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/mysql.jar"/>
</path>
```

Note the distinction between `id` with `properties`: you cannot obtain the value of a reference by wrapping it in `${}` markers as you would for a property.

### 5.2. Setting a Classpath Pathlike Structure

The `<classpath>` element is analogous to the `<path>` element, except that it cannot appear as a child element of `<project>` or `<target>`, it cannot contain child `<classpath>` elements, and it cannot be given a reference ID.

The `<classpath>` element can contain a child `<path>` element, which you would use in the same way as the `<path>` child element. If you simply want to use **an existing pathlike structure** as **a classpath pathlike structure**, use the `refid` attribute.

Using an Existing Pathlike Structure As a Classpath

```xml
<property environment="env"/>

<parenttask>
    <classpath>
        <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
    </classpath>
</parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <!-- A short-form version of the above -->
    <classpath path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
</parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <classpath>
        <path refid="build.path.id"/>
        <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/mysql.jar"/>
    </classpath>
<parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <classpath refid="build.path.id"/>
</parenttask>
```
