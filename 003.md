<!-- /TOC -->

Now that you have installed Ant, you are ready to start using it. However, Ant is nothing without its build files. You must provide Ant with a description of the project before you can start to build the project.

## 1. Running Ant from the Command Line

The usual method of running Ant is to use the `ant` shell script supplied in `ANT_HOME/bin`.

The `ant` script has a number of options at the command line. You can see what these are by running `ant -h`. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
ant [options] [target [target2 [target3] ...]]
```

The list of targets tells Ant which targets to execute in the build file.

## 2. Introducing Ant’s Build File Syntax

### 2.1. Examining the Project Element

The Minimum Requirements for a Build File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project>

</project>
```

Generating an Incomplete DTD

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project>
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</project>
```

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClientConfig

I was able to solve the problem by downloading commons-net-3.2-bin.tar.gz from http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/download_net.cgi and installing commons-net-3.2.jar into my /usr/local/ant/lib folder.

According to https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/ftp.html, you need to install Apache Commons Net and Jakarta Oro.

Copy these jars to your `\lib` directory, as Jason Posit said.

All in all, you may find it more straightforward to not work with DTDs, and you’ll find that few source bundles come with DTD declarations.

Ant will always run any **tasks** that you set as child elements of `<project>`, which means every run of the project will include these tasks. If you want to control which tasks Ant runs, or you want to group related build steps (and you do), then you need to use **targets**, as defined by the `<target>` element. `<target>` elements are child elements of `<project>`, and you place tasks inside them so that you have more control over your builds. You can set a target as a default so that Ant will run it if you do not specify a target at the command line. To do so, use the `<project>` element’s `default` attribute.

You set the base directory of the current build with the `<project>` element’s `basedir` attribute. If you do not specify a default directory, the default is the parent directory of the `build.xml` file.

Lastly, you can give the project **a name**, which is useful as a description.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<target name="build-dtd">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

### 2.2. Examining the Target Element

A target is a collection of Ant tasks that you want to run as a unit. Each target should represent a discrete step of your build process and no more.

The `<target>` element is the XML representation of a target in the build file. As already mentioned, it is a child element of `<project>`. It also can contain as many task elements as are required. When Ant calls a target, each of these tasks runs in turn until they all complete or one fails. You can chain targets together so that one target will not execute until another has completed all its tasks successfully. By setting these dependencies, you can start to build a description of the build process.

The `<target>` element’s only mandatory attribute is `name`. The `name` allows you to call the target from the command line or from within the build file. You can accomplish the latter with the `<project>` element’s `default` attribute or with certain tasks.

You can provide the target with a description using the `description` attribute, and Ant uses this description when you call it with the `-projecthelp` option. In this case, Ant will display only the names and descriptions of targets that have descriptions. Ant is assuming that if it isn’t important enough to have a description, it isn’t important enough to be shown as a major target that you would want to run.<sub>注：这样一个假设，真是“有意思”</sub>

```bash
ant -projecthelp
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<target name="build-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

To run this target, execute the following in the same directory as the build file:

```bash
ant build-dtd
```

The `<description>` element adds a master description to a build file if you use it as a child element of `<project>`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Book Project"
    basedir="."
    default="build-dtd">

<description>
    Apache Ant book example project. The main targets are listed below.
</description>

<target name="build-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

If you want Ant to always run one target before running another one, such as an initialization target before a compilation target, then you need to specify the name of the first target you want to run in the second target’s `depends` attribute.

```xml
<project name="Apache Ant Project" basedir="." default="build-dtd">

<target name="pre-dtd">
...
</target>

<target name="build-dtd" depends="pre-dtd" description="Create an Ant DTD">
    <antstructure output="./project.dtd"/>
</target>

</project>
```

In this example, the `build-dtd` target depends on the `pre-dtd` target. Once `pre-dtd` finishes successfully, `build-dtd` runs any tasks that it contains.

You can set as many target names in `depends` as you want by separating each name with **a comma**. Ant works through them one at a time until they all succeed or one fails.

## 3. Working with Properties

**Ant tasks** use **Ant properties** to set attribute values at run time, which means the values of those attributes are not hard-coded.

The `${}` notation used by Ant means “display the value of this property.” It is quite easy to forget that you want to specify the name of the property rather than its value.

You may want to set the base directory of the build at run time to allow for changes in directory structure. To do so, you have to place a property marker in the `basedir` attribute of the `<project>` element

A Property Marker in the `<project>` Element

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project basedir="${base.dir}">
</project>
```

The `${base.dir}` string inserts the value of the `base.dir` property at run time. If the `base.dir` property has not been set, Ant uses the literal string. This may or may not be a problem depending on the situation.

### 3.1. Using Built-in Properties

Ant provides you with certain built-in properties that you may find useful during your build process. They mainly provide information about the version of Ant and Java you are using and the current project, the latter of which you can use to set other paths in the project.

Ant’s Built-in Properties

| Property           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ant.file`         | The absolute path to the current build file.                 |
| `ant.java.version` | The version of Java that Ant uses.                           |
| `ant.project.name` | The name of the project as set in the `<project>` element’s `name` attribute. If you have not set this attribute, Ant will substitute the literal string `${ant.project.name}`. |
| `ant.version`      | The version of this Ant installation. This is not just the version number and includes information such as the compilation date. |
| `basedir`          | The base directory for this build, as defined in the `basedir` attribute of the `<project>` element. If you do not set this attribute, Ant uses the current directory. |

The `<echo>` task will display the specified message to standard `out` and is a good way to demonstrate the substitution that occurs when you use properties.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Properties Project" basedir=".">

<target name="properties.built-in">
    <echo message="The base directory: ${basedir}"/>
    <echo message="This file: ${ant.file}"/>
    <echo message="Ant version: ${ant.version}"/>
    <echo message="Project name: ${ant.project.name}"/>
    <echo message="Java version: ${ant.java.version}"/>
</target>

</project>
```

#### 3.1.1. Accessing System Properties

Ant also gives you access to the Java system properties as if you had called `java.lang.System.getProperties()`. This can, for example, allow you to build platform-specific paths and directory hierarchies.

Building a Platform-Specific Path

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Properties Project" basedir=".">

<target name="build.path">
    <echo message="File: ${basedir}${file.separator}build.xml"/>
    <echo message="Path: ${basedir}${file.separator}build.xml${path.separator}${basedir}${file.separator}build.properties"/>
</target>

</project>
```

### 3.2. Setting Properties in the Build File

The first method of providing custom properties is with `<property>` elements in an Ant build file. Unlike the `<project>` and `<target>` elements, the `<property>` element is defined as **a task**. This means you can include `<property>` elements inside **a target** so that properties can be set conditionally, depending on certain conditions or depending on which target has been selected.

You can also set properties at the beginning of a build file so that they apply to the entire build. This means you can set important constant values in a central location so that they are easy to find and change, should the project change. You should remember that properties set inside a target override any properties set at the project level.

#### 3.2.1. Using a Name-Value Pair

The simplest and most obvious use of the `<property>` task is to set a property using a name-value pair

Setting a Property with a Name-Value Pair

```xml
<target name="properties.custom">
    <property name="build.no" value="1.1"/>
    <echo message="Build no. = ${build.no}"/>
</target>
```

#### 3.2.2. Using a File Location

The `name` property has two other potential partners you can use to set a property. The first is `location`, which you can use to set the value of a property to the location of a file. If you supply a relative path, Ant will expand the path to make it absolute and then store it as the value of the property. If you provide an absolute name, Ant will store it as is, though with the path separa-tors adjusted for the platform as appropriate.

Setting a Property to a Filename Using a Relative Path

```xml
<target name="properties.custom">
    <property name="project.dtd" location="project.dtd"/>
    <echo message="Location of project.dtd: ${project.dtd}"/>
</target>
```

#### 3.2.3. Using a Reference

The second partner to `name` is `refid`, which is a reference to **an object** defined elsewhere in the file. The reference allows you to reuse chunks of the build file (termed **an object** in this case) so that common classpaths and paths can be shared among targets. **Many tasks** have a `refid` attribute, and they all perform similar tasks. In the case of the `<property>` task, the `refid` attribute assigns the value of the referenced object to the property named with the `name` attribute. There is no point in assigning anything other than a pathlike structure in this case because you won’t be able to use any other kind of reference once it has been stored in the property.

Ant Converts a String into the Appropriate Path

```xml
<target name="properties.custom">
    <!-- Windows users should leave this line uncommented -->
    <property name="build.path" value="${basedir}/build.xml:${basedir}/build.properties"/>

    <!-- Unix users should remove the above line and uncomment the below line -->
    <!--
    <property name="build.path" value="${basedir}\build.xml;${basedir}\build.properties"/>
    -->

    <path id="build.path.id">
        <pathelement path="${build.path}"/>
    </path>

    <property name="build.path.property" refid="build.path.id"/>

    <!-- The converted string that Ant uses as a path -->
    <echo message="Converted string: ${build.path.property}"/>
    <!-- The unconverted string, which Ant treats as a string -->
    <echo message="Path: ${build.path}"/>
</target>
```

#### 3.2.4. Accessing Environment Variables

The final technique available to you when setting properties in the build file is using the `environment` attribute of the `<property>` element. You should use this attribute by itself only and not in combination with any of the other techniques supplied.

The `environment` attribute gives you access to the operating system’s environment variables so that you can use them in your build process. For example, you may want to add a note about which architecture the build was carried out on or use the system classpath as the classpath when Ant compiles the Java classes.

The value you set in the `environment` attribute is the prefix you must use when referencing an environment variable in the build file. So, if you set the value of `environment` to `env`, you would reference the system classpath using `${env.CLASSPATH}`. Ant is case-sensitive in this case, even if the host operating system is not.

Gaining Access to the System’s Environment Variables

```xml
<target name="properties.environment">
    <property environment="env"/>
    <echo message="Java Home: ${env.JAVA_HOME}"/>
    <echo message="ANT_HOME: ${env.ANT_HOME}"/>
</target>
```

### 3.3. Setting Properties in Property Files

The most common technique is for developers and users to make a copy of the master properties file (`build.properties.default`), name it `build.properties`, and place it in the
base directory. You must then make sure you import the `build.properties` file before the `build.properties.default` file. This means that local settings override the defaults . Another technique is to encourage developers and users to copy the `build.properties` file to their “home” directory and use the `${user.home}` system property to reference its new location. This file then takes precedence over the default file.

You can of course set all your properties in a properties file if you want to enforce absolute centralization.

#### 3.3.1. Writing a Property File

Ant property files must conform to the same format as Java property files, as used by the `java.util.Properties` class. This means all characters must be in ISO 8859-1 format, and if they are not, you can use the `native2ascii` tool that comes with the Java distribution to convert the file.

Each property is represented by a name-value pair, separated with an equals sign, and comments are delimited with a hash character

The Basic Syntax of a Properties File

```txt
# A comment is indicated by a hash mark
property.name=property.value
```

You can load a property file and, thus, the properties it contains in three ways: from a local file using a filename, from a URL, and from a file located on Ant’s classpath.

One particularly nice feature of Ant property files is **in-file property expansion**. This feature means you can use properties set in a file to build the values of other properties set in that file. You can use this technique to your advantage in a number of situations, including building classpaths from third-party JARs and setting server names.

In-File Property Expansion in a Property File

```txt
server.name=localhost
server.port=8080
server.scheme=http
server.manager.name=manager

server.url=${server.scheme}://${server.name}:${server.port}/${server.manager.name}/

j2ee.jar=${env.J2EE_HOME}/lib/j2ee.jar
jsp.jar=${env.CATALINA_HOME}/common/lib/jsp-api.jar
servlet.jar=${env.CATALINA_HOME}/common/lib/servlet-api.jar
mysql.jar=${env.CATALINA_HOME}/common/lib/mysql.jar

build.classpath=${mysql.jar};${j2ee.jar};${jsp.jar};${servlet.jar}
```

#### 3.3.2. Loading Properties from a Local File

If you want to use a local property file, then you must specify its location with the `file` attribute of the `<property>` task.

Loading a Local Property File

```xml
<target name="properties.localfile">
    <property file="build.properties"/>

    <path id="build.classpath.id">
        <pathelement path="${build.classpath}"/>
    </path>

    <property name="build.classpath.property" refid="build.classpath.id"/>

    <echo message="Server URL: ${server.url}"/>
    <echo message="Build classpath: ${build.classpath}"/>
    <echo message="Build classpath converted: ${build.classpath.property}"/>
</target>
```

### 3.4. Setting Properties at the Command Line

The final way to set properties is at the command line. You can specify individual properties using the `-Dproperty=value` syntax, or you can load the properties from a property file using the `-propertyfile` option. As noted at the beginning of the chapter, the `-Dproperty=value` syntax takes precedence. In fact, `-Dproperty=value` takes precedence over all property values in the build. For example, if you wanted to override the server name because the main development server is down, you can run the following:

```bash
ant -Dserver.name=remotehost properties.localfile
```

## 4. Using Properties to Control a Build

### 4.1. Using the Available Task

The `<available>` task sets the value of a property if a resource exists when you run the build process. The default value of the property is `true`, which is enough for the purposes of the `if` and `unless` attributes, which check to see whether a property is set. In other words, they don’t care what the value is.

Using the `<available>` Element to Check for the Existence of Third-Party Files

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="Apache Ant Available Project" basedir="." default="build-jstl">

<property name="jstl.src" value="./src/jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="./lib/jstl.jar"/>

<available property="jstl.src.exists" file="${jstl.src}"/>
<available property="jstl.jar.exists" file="${jstl.jar}"/>

<target name="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.src.exists">
    <echo message="Checking out ${jstl.jar}"/>
    ...
</target>

<target name="build-jstl" depends="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.jar.exists">
    <echo message="Building ${jstl.jar}"/>
    ...
</target>

</project>
```

The following shows how to use the `filepath` attribute to replace the paths in the properties:

```xml
<property name="jstl.src" value="jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="jstl.jar"/>

<available property="jstl.src.exists" file="${jstl.src}" filepath="./src"/>
<available property="jstl.jar.exists" file="${jstl.jar}" filepath="./lib"/>
```

### 4.2. Using the Uptodate Task

Using a File Set As Part of an `<uptodate>` Check

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<uptodate property="uptodate" targetfile="./One.java">
    <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
</uptodate>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

Using a File Set and Mapper As Part of an `<uptodate>` Check

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<uptodate property="uptodate">
    <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
    <mapper type="merge" to="./One.java"/>
</uptodate>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

### 4.3. Using the Condition Task

Using the `<condition>` Task Instead of the `<available>` and `<uptodate>` Tasks

```xml
<fileset dir="." id="uptodate.id">
    <include name="src/jstl/One.java"/>
</fileset>

<property name="jstl.src" value="jstl"/>
<property name="jstl.jar" value="jstl.jar"/>

<condition property="jstl.src.exists">
    <available file="${jstl.src}" filepath="./src"/>
</condition>

<condition property="jstl.jar.exists">
    <available file="${jstl.jar}" filepath="./lib"/>
</condition>

<condition property="uptodate">
    <uptodate>
        <srcfiles refid="uptodate.id"/>
        <mapper type="merge" to="./One.java"/>
    </uptodate>
</condition>

<target name="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.src.exists">
    <echo message="Checking out ${jstl.jar}"/>
</target>

<target name="build-jstl" depends="checkout-jstl" unless="jstl.jar.exists">
    <echo message="Building ${jstl.jar}"/>
</target>

<target name="compile" if="uptodate">
    <echo message="File changed: ${uptodate}"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.1. Using the `<os>` Test

If you are working with a project that needs to check the operating system on which it is built and carry out actions appropriately, then you can use the `<os>` nested element.

For `arch`, `name`, and `version`, Ant calls the appropriate line in the following and compares the value with that specified in the attribute:

```java
System.getProperty("os.arch");
System.getProperty("os.name");
System.getProperty("os.version");
```

Using the `<os>` Element’s family Attribute to Test the Operating System

```xml
<condition property="is.windows">
    <os family="windows"/>
</condition>

<condition property="is.unix">
    <os family="unix"/>
</condition>

<target name="do-windows" if="is.windows">
    <echo message="This is Windows"/>
</target>

<target name="do-unix" if="is.unix">
    <echo message="This is Unix"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.2. Using the `<equals>` Test

The `<equals>` nested element tests two strings to see if they are equal. This is a classic example of `if` functionality, and you can use it to check the values of properties or filenames.

#### 4.3.3. Using the `<isset>` Test

The `<isset>` element tests whether a property has been set in this project. You may find this test most useful when used in conjunction with other tests. For example, you may want to test to see whether a command-line property has been set and that a certain file exists and then run a target only if this is the case.

#### 4.3.4. Using the `<istrue>` and `<isfalse>` Tests

The `<istrue>` and `<isfalse>` tests are related to and extend the `<isset>` test, but check that the value of the property is `true` or `false`, respectively. Ant also considers `yes` and `on` to equal `true` and considers `no` and `off` to equal `false`, so these values also satisfy these tests.

#### 4.3.5. Using the `<isreference>` Test

The `<isreference>` test checks whether the given ID is indeed a valid reference. You can also check whether this ID refers to a certain type of Ant structure.

A File Set Reference Is Tested Using the `<isreference>` Test

```xml
<condition property="is.fileset">
    <isreference refid="uptodate.id" type="fileset"/>
</condition>

<target name="fileset-prepare">
    <echo message="Value of is.fileset = ${is.fileset}"/>
</target>
```

#### 4.3.6. Using the `<isfileselected>` Test

The `<isfileselected>` test succeeds if a given file matches all the conditions specified as nested selectors. Use it as you would a file set.

#### 4.3.7. Using the `<checksum>` Test

You use this test to check that a file matches the checksum supplied as part of a download.

#### 4.3.8. Using the `<http>` Test

The `<http>` test checks that a web server provides a valid response and sets the property if this is the case. This allows you to check whether a server is listening to requests before you begin a download from it.

#### 4.3.9. Using the `<socket>` Test

The `<socket>` test checks that a process is listening at the specified server and port. Again, you can use this to check that you can run a target that requires this to be the case.

#### 4.3.10. Using the `<filesmatch>` Test

The `<filesmatch>` test checks whether two files are identical.

#### 4.3.11. Using the `<contains>` Test

The `<contains>` attribute represents another classic if function: checking whether a string contains another string.

#### 4.3.12. Using the `<length>` Test

The `<length>` test checks the length of a string or a file. It is actually a task in its own right, but you can place it as a nested element of `<condition>` to use it as a test. This extends the functionality of the task in some ways, but reduces it in others.

#### 4.3.13. Using Logical Operators

The three logical operators are `<not>`, `<and>`, and `<or>`.

### 4.4. Working with Property Sets

## 5. Using Pathlike Structures

### 5.1. Setting a Pathlike Structure

A pathlike structure is a reusable collection of files or directories that has a unique ID so that whenever you want to use it, you supply its reference ID.

Another way you can use pathlike structures is when you want to perform multiple operations on the same group of files or directories.

Building Pathlike Structures

```xml
<property environment="env"/>

<path id="build.path.id">
    <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
</path>

<!-- A short-form version of the above -->
<path id="build.path.id" path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>

<path id="build.path.complete">
    <path refid="build.path.id"/>
    <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/mysql.jar"/>
</path>
```

Note the distinction between `id` with `properties`: you cannot obtain the value of a reference by wrapping it in `${}` markers as you would for a property.

### 5.2. Setting a Classpath Pathlike Structure

The `<classpath>` element is analogous to the `<path>` element, except that it cannot appear as a child element of `<project>` or `<target>`, it cannot contain child `<classpath>` elements, and it cannot be given a reference ID.

The `<classpath>` element can contain a child `<path>` element, which you would use in the same way as the `<path>` child element. If you simply want to use **an existing pathlike structure** as **a classpath pathlike structure**, use the `refid` attribute.

Using an Existing Pathlike Structure As a Classpath

```xml
<property environment="env"/>

<parenttask>
    <classpath>
        <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
    </classpath>
</parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <!-- A short-form version of the above -->
    <classpath path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/ant.jar"/>
</parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <classpath>
        <path refid="build.path.id"/>
        <pathelement path="${env.ANT_HOME}/lib/mysql.jar"/>
    </classpath>
<parenttask>

<parenttask>
    <classpath refid="build.path.id"/>
</parenttask>
```
