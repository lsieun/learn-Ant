# 002. Installing Ant

## Downloading a Binary Distribution

URL: https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

## Verifying the Binary Distribution


## Unpacking the Binary Distribution

If you downloaded the `*.tar.gz` file, navigate to the directory where the archive is, and run the following:

```bash
sudo tar -xzf apache-ant-bin.tar.gz -C /usr/local

```

## Taking Final Steps After Installation

The final step of installation is to set the `ANT_HOME` environment variable. This allows Ant to find the classes that it depends on, which means you can run it from anywhere on your file system.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/profile
```

```txt
export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/ant
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk8
export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin:${JAVA_HOME}/bin
```
