# Property

Unlike Java variables, Ant properties are **immutable**: you cannot change them. The first task, project, or person to set a property fixes it for that build. This rule is the opposite of most languages, but it’s a rule that lets you control build files from the outside, from tools such as IDEs, or from automated build systems. It’s also the key to letting different users customize a build file to work on their system, without editing the build file itself. Simply by defining the appropriate property on the command line, you can change the behavior of your own or someone else’s build file. Inside the build file, properties let you define a piece of information once and share it across many tasks. This makes maintenance easier and reduces errors.
