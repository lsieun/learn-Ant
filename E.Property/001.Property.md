Ant **properties** contain string values that can be used wherever a string is needed in a build file. They can be set in **tasks** or on the **command line**, and can both control the build process and configure it.

Properties are key-value pairs where Apache Ant tries to expand `${key}` to value at run time.

## 1. How to Use Properties

Properties are expanded by surrounding them with `${}`, such as in the string "`ant.file = ${ant.file}`". Properties written like this will be expanded in all string assignments to task attributes, and inside most task text elements.

For example, to examine the built-in properties, we can use the `<echo>` task:

```xml
<target name="echo">
    <echo message="ant.file = ${ant.file}"/>
    <echo message="ant.home = ${ant.home}"/>
    <echo message="ant.java.version = ${ant.java.version}"/>
    <echo>basedir = ${basedir}</echo>
</target>
```

```xml
<echo>host=${host}</echo>
```

**If the property is defined, the `${host}` is replaced with its value; if it isn’t, it stays as is.**

## 2. Existing properties

### 2.1. built-in properties

Ant provides various **built-in properties**, properties that the runtime sets for you.

与Ant软件相关的：

- `ant.java.version`: the JVM version Ant detected; currently it can hold the values 9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2.
- `ant.version`: the version of Ant
- `ant.core.lib`: the absolute path of the `ant.jar` file.
- `ant.home`: home directory of Ant
- `ant.library.dir`: the directory that has been used to load Ant's jars from. In most cases this is `ANT_HOME/lib`.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="HelloWorld" default="echo" basedir=".">
    <target name="echo">
        <echo message="ant.java.version = ${ant.java.version}"/>
        <echo message="     ant.version = ${ant.version}"/>
        <echo message="        ant.home = ${ant.home}"/>
        <echo message=" ant.library.dir = ${ant.library.dir}"/>
        <echo message="    ant.core.lib = ${ant.core.lib}"/>
    </target>
</project>
```

与项目文件相关的：

- `ant.file`: the absolute path of the buildfile.
- `ant.project.name`: the name of the project that is currently executing; it is set in the `name` attribute of `<project>`.
- `ant.project.default-target`: the name of the currently executing project's default target; it is set via the `default` attribute of `<project>`.
- `basedir`: the absolute path of the project's basedir (as set with the `basedir` attribute of `<project>`).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="myproject" default="mytarget" basedir=".">
    <target name="mytarget">
        <echo message="                  ant.file = ${ant.file}"/>
        <echo message="          ant.project.name = ${ant.project.name}"/>
        <echo message="ant.project.default-target = ${ant.project.default-target}"/>
        <echo message="                   basedir = ${basedir}"/>
    </target>
</project>
```

与运行时输入的target参数相关：

- `ant.project.invoked-targets`: a comma-separated list of the targets that have been specified (on the command line, inside of an IDE, by an `<ant>` task, etc...) when invoking the current project. This property is set properly when the first target is executed. If you use it in the implicit target (directly under the `<project>` tag) the list will be empty if no target has been specified while it will contain the project's `default` target in this case for tasks nested into targets.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="myproject" default="secondtarget" basedir=".">

    <echo message="ant.project.invoked-targets = ${ant.project.invoked-targets}"/>

    <target name="firsttarget">
        <echo message="first target"/>
    </target>
    <target name="secondtarget">
        <echo message="second target"/>
    </target>
</project>
```

### 2.2. JVM system properties

All JVM system properties are provided as Ant properties, letting your build files determine user’s home directory path and the current username. The JVM system properties will vary from platform to platform, but there are many that you can rely on, for example,

```xml
<echo message="user.name = ${user.name}"/>
<echo message="user.home = ${user.home}"/>
<echo message="java.home = ${java.home}"/>
```


### 2.3. all properties

If you’re curious about the set of properties at any point in a build file, the `<echoproperties>` task can list the current set to the console or to a file. On its own, this task will list all properties in the order they’re stored in the hashtable:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="HelloWorld" default="echoall" basedir=".">
    <!-- 也可以显示自定义的属性 -->
    <property name="zzz.yyy.xxx" value="xyz"/>
    <target name="echoall">
        <echoproperties />
    </target>
</project>
```

The XML output is sorted, which makes it easy to browse. You could also **save the list to a file** to compare against a previous version.

```xml
<target name="echoxml">
    <echoproperties format="xml" destfile="current-properties.xml" />
</target>
```

Listing properties or saving them to a file is useful while learning about properties and for diagnostics. We often have a diagnostics target that lists the current set of properties.

**Being able to read properties is only half the problem. How do you set them?**

## 3. How to set properties

There are many tasks that can set properties; the most common one is the `<property>` task. In addition properties can be defined via **command line arguments** or similar mechanisms from outside of Ant.

Ant provides many ways to assign properties, the most popular being

- Name/value assignment
- Name/location assignment
- Loading a set of properties from a properties file
- Reading environment variables

### 3.1. Setting properties with the `<property>` task

The `<property>` task is the normal way to set properties.

A common action in a build file is selecting one of two choices, such as whether to compile debug information into the `.class` files. Development releases need this, while production builds may opt to omit it. This choice can be managed through a property.

We can define a property named `build.debug` and set its value to `true`.

```xml
<property name="build.debug" value="true"/>
```

This property can be passed to the `debug` attribute in a `<javac>` task:

```xml
<javac srcdir="src" debug="${build.debug}"/>
```

The `<property name="key" value="xyz">` assignment is the easiest way to set a property in the build file, and it’s ideal for simple values. However, it isn’t the best way to set filenames or paths, where the `location` attribute is preferable.

### 3.2. Setting a property to a filename

The `location` attribute of the `<property>` task converts a **relative path** into an **absolute location** and converts **directory separators** to that of the target platform. Build file authors can choose between forward slashes (`/`) or backslashes (`\`) based on personal preference:

```xml
<property name="release.dir" location="../release" />
```

This resolved path can be passed down to native programs or Java code, as it’s now absolute and platform-specific. The directory against which relative paths are resolved is **the base directory of the project**, which is typically the directory where `build.xml` resides. The built-in property `basedir` is set to this directory.

File locations are always set using `<property name="abc" location="xyz">`. You can often get away with using the `value` attribute instead; many build files do.<sub>注：如果想表达文件位置，则使用`<property>`的location属性，而不是value属性</sub>

In addition to setting properties in the build file, Ant can be configured by properties in **external files**.

### 3.3. Loading properties from a properties file

Loading properties from **a Java properties file** is a common way of customizing builds.

We can create a file named `build.properties` in the root directory of our project, alongside the build file. This file has a comment and some properties:

```txt
#properties for the build
build.debug=false
```

Ant’s `<property>` task will load the file in the file attribute:

```xml
<property file="build.properties"/>
```

Property values in the properties file are expanded during the load. Consider a properties file containing these lines:

```xml
build.dir=build
output.dir=${build.dir}/output
```

When loaded, `output.dir` will have the value `build/output`.

All properties loaded from a properties file are loaded as **simple string values**, as if they were set by the `<property value>` operation. To turn them into **absolute values**, the build file would have to reassign them.

```xml
<property name="output.dir.absolute" location="${output.dir}"/>
```

This would resolve it to a path such as `/home/erik/ch02/build/output`.

There are **two other issues** with **property file** loading that developers need to know. **One** is that to use a **backslash** in the file, it must **be repeated twice**:

```txt
release.dir=..\\release
```

This is because the file is loaded using the `java.util.Properties` class, which requires this.

**The other quirk** is that if you **misspell the name of the file**, with something such as `<property file="build.propertoes"/>` , Ant doesn’t stop the build. Indeed, it doesn’t even warn of a problem, except when you run Ant in verbose (`-v`) mode. This seems like a bug, but it’s actually deliberate. It lets you offer the option to control the build, without making it mandatory. To understand how to do that, you need to understand Ant’s unusual property assignment model.

### 3.4. Loading environment variables

The `<property>` task can import environment variables into Ant properties. In order to avoid colliding with existing Ant properties, environment variables are loaded with a name prefix. The convention is to use the prefix `env`:

```xml
<property environment="env"/>
```

All environment variables are loaded into Ant’s internal properties with the prefix `env.` (including the trailing period). This gives us properties like `env.PATH`, or, on Windows NT platforms, `env.Path`. Tasks in the build can use these settings and change them before executing native and Java programs.

## 4. Feature

### 4.1. immutable

Unlike Java variables, **Ant properties** are **immutable**: you cannot change them. The first task, project, or person to set a property fixes it for that build. This rule is the opposite of most languages, but it’s a rule that lets you control build files from the outside, from tools such as IDEs, or from automated build systems. It’s also the key to letting different users customize a build file to work on their system, without editing the build file itself. Simply by defining the appropriate property on the command line, you can change the behavior of your own or someone else’s build file. Inside the build file, properties let you define a piece of information once and share it across many tasks. This makes maintenance easier and reduces errors.
