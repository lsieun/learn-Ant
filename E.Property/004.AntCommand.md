# And Command

Ant users can set Ant properties on **the command line** before Ant does any work.

Ant has two command-line options to set properties: `-D` and `-propertyfile`.

```bash
ant -Dhost=localhost
```

Nothing can override a property set from the command line. Ant has **two classes of properties**, **user properties** and **standard properties**. **User properties** consist of **system properties** and **command-line defined properties**, as well as properties overridden
using `<ant>`. Properties defined on the command line get set as **user properties** and are truly immutable, ignoring even the immutability exceptions noted earlier.

You can also name files of properties to load, using the `-propertyfile` option and following it with a filename:

```bash
ant -propertyfile build.properties -f properties.xml echoall
```

This will load the property file before the build file itself is executed. This trick has the following rules:

- (1) Properties defined with `-Dname=value` options take precedence.
- (2) If the property file is missing, a warning is printed but the build continues.
- (3) Properties in the loaded file aren’t expanded.

Items `(2)` and `(3)` are different behaviors from that of `<property file>` file loading, which is more common. The fact that property expansion doesn’t take place can cause surprises.
