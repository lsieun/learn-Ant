# Viewing datatypes

**Ant properties aren’t datatypes**. While **properties** and **datatypes** are independent from one another for most practical purposes, there are **a couple of interesting intersections between them**. The ubiquitous `<property>` task can convert any reference to its string representation by calling the `toString()` operation on the datatype.

As an example, let’s turn a path into a string. First, the path:

```xml
<path id="the.path">
    <pathelement path="some.jar;another.jar"/>
</path>
```

A `<property>` and an `<echo>` can display the value:

```xml
<property name="path.string" refid="the.path"/>
<echo message="path = ${path.string}"/>
```

The `<path>` datatype resolves all relative items to their absolute paths and converts all file and path separators to the local platform, and so the result on Linux platform is

```txt
[echo] path = /home/ant/ch03/some.jar:/home/ant/ch03/another.jar
```

On Windows, the result would be different, something like

```txt
[echo] path = C:\ch03\some.jar;C:\ch03\another.jar
```

The path elements have been converted to the local form, resolved to **absolute locations**, and separated by the current `${path.separator}` value. Printing properties is invaluable for diagnosing path problems.

Converting **datatype references** to their **string value** is such a common activity that Ant has a shortcut to let you do it. To have the `toString()` method called on any datatype, just call `${toString:id}`, where `id` is the name of the reference:

```xml
<echo message="the.path is ${toString:the.path}"/>
```

This technique works for any Ant datatype that has a useful toString() value.
