# SELECTORS

Filenames are a common way of selecting files for operations, but not always enough.

## selector containers

These selectors can be combined inside selector containers to provide grouping and logic. The containers are `<and>`, `<or>`, `<not>`, `<none>`, `<selector>`, and `<majority>`.

Containers may be nested inside containers, enabling complex selection logic.

## Antâ€™s built-in selectors

Any fileset can be restricted by these selectors to choose only those files that match the specific tests.
