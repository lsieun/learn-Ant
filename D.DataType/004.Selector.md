Filenames are a common way of selecting files for operations, but not always enough. Sometimes you want to delete out-of-date files or upload only changed files to a remote site. What if you want to delete files, leaving directories in their place? You can do all these things by refining the fileset with **selectors**.

Each **selector** is a test that’s applied to each file in the fileset (or other selector container). It narrows down the
selection of files in the fileset.

## 1. Ant’s built-in selectors

Any fileset can be restricted by these selectors to choose only those files that match the specific tests.

Works like a patternset `<include>` or `<exclude>` element to match files based on a pattern

Selects files based on a directory depth range

Selects files that are less, equal to, or more than a specified size

Selects files (and optionally directories) that have been last modified before, after, or on a specified date

Selects files if they exist in another directory tree

Selects files that are newer than corresponding ones in another directory tree

文件内容

Selects files that contain a string

Select files that contain a regular expression-described string

Selects files that are different from those in another directory

类型

Selects by type of file or directory

Calculates (and caches) checksums for files; selects those that have changed

Selects signed JAR files, optionally naming the signatory

Inline script language containing a selection rule

### present selector

To compare two directory trees and copy the files that exist in one tree but not in another, we use a combination of `<not>` and `<present>`:

```xml
<copy todir="newfiles" includeemptydirs="false">
    <fileset dir="web">
        <not>
            <present targetdir="currentfiles"/>
        </not>
    </fileset>
</copy>
```

This `<copy>` task will copy only the files from the `web` directory that don’t exist in the `currentfiles` directory.

### contains selector

Using the `<contains>` selector, we choose only those files containing a certain string:

```xml
<copy todir="currentfiles" includeemptydirs="false">
    <fileset dir="web">
        <contains text="System"/>
    </fileset>
</copy>
```

Only the files containing the text “System” in the `web` directory are copied to the `currentfiles` directory. By default `<contains>` is case-sensitive, but it can be changed using `casesensitive="no"`.

## 2. selector containers

These selectors can be combined inside selector containers to provide grouping and logic. The containers are `<and>`, `<or>`, `<not>`, `<none>`, `<selector>`, and `<majority>`.

Containers may be nested inside containers, enabling complex selection logic.
