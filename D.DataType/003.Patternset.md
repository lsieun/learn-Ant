## 1. pattern matching

### 1.1. pattern rules

The rules for pattern matching in the strings are as follows:

- "`*`" matches zero or more characters.
- "`?`" matches a single character.
- "`**`" , used as **the name of a directory**, represents matching of all directories from that point down, matching zero or more directories.
- A pattern ending with a trailing "`/`" or "`\`" implies a trailing "`**`" . That is, a directory includes its subdirectories.
- The directory separators "`/`" and "`\`" are converted into the correct separator for the local platform.
- Everything else is treated as simple text.

### 1.2. patternset in fileset

A `fileset` can contain multiple `patternsets`, which restrict the files in the `fileset` to those that match or don’t match a specified pattern.

We can use one to include all JSP files under a `web` directory:

```xml
<copy todir="newweb">
    <fileset dir="web" includes="**/*.jsp"/>
</copy>
```

This patternset is equivalent to

```xml
<copy todir="newweb">
    <fileset dir="web">
        <include name="**/*.jsp"/>
    </fileset>
</copy>
```

Had we specified just `*.jsp`, only the JSP files in the `web` directory would have been copied, but the files in any subdirectories wouldn’t have been copied.

### 1.3. Patternsets nested within another

Patternsets may be nested within one another, such as

```xml
<patternset>
    <include name="**/*.gif"/>
    <include name="**/*.jpg"/>
    <patternset>
        <exclude name="**/*.txt"/>
        <exclude name="**/*.xml"/>
    </patternset>
</patternset>
```

A `patternset` is just **a collection of file-matching patterns**. The `patternset` itself doesn’t refer to any actual files until it’s nested in a `fileset`<sub>注：换句话说，patternset要在fileset中才能生效</sub> and, therefore, rooted at a specific directory. The patterns it supports are simple regular expressions on a directory path.

As well as being embedded inside `filesets`, `patternsets` can be specified independently as **standalone datatypes**.

## 2. attributes

**Including and excluding patterns** allows filesets to be defined precisely to encompass only the files desired.

Title: `Patternset attributes`

| Attribute      | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `includes`     | Comma-separated list of patterns of files that must be included. All files are included when omitted. |
| `excludes`     | Comma-separated list of patterns of files that must be excluded. No files (except default excludes) are excluded when omitted. |
| `includesfile` | The name of a file; each line of this file is taken to be an include pattern. You can specify more than one include file by using nested `<includesfile>` elements. |
| `excludesfile` | The name of a file; each line of this file is taken to be an exclude pattern. You can specify more than one exclude file by using nested `<excludesfile>` elements. |

## 3. netsted element

The `<patternset>` datatype also has **elements** for every aspect of the pattern, which makes it easy to list **multiple patterns** inside a single `<patternset>`. The elements are `<include>`, `<exclude>`, `<includesfile>`, and `<excludesfile>`. Each of these elements has a `name` attribute. For `<include>` and `<exclude>`, the `name` attribute specifies **the pattern to be included or excluded**, respectively. For the `<includesfile>` and `<excludesfile>` elements, the `name` attribute represents **a filename**. Each of these elements has `if/ unless` attributes.

Here is an example of a patternset:

```xml
<patternset>
    <include name="*.jsp"/>
</patternset>
```

This patternset includes all JSP pages in a single directory.

## 4. precedence

**Exclusion patterns take precedence**<sub>注：优先级</sub>, so that if a file matches both an **include** and **exclude** pattern, the file is excluded.

Here’s an example:

```xml
<patternset>
    <include name="**/*.jsp"/>
    <exclude name="**/test/broken?.jsp"/>
</patternset>
```

This one includes all JSP pages in a directory tree, except any in the directory `test` and the local name consisting of `broken?.jsp` , such as `broken1.jsp`, or `brokenC.jsp`. As you can see, **explicit exclusion is a powerful tool**.

## 5. default excludes

One thing that’s important to know is that some file types are excluded by default, the **default excludes** patterns. In many builds, special or temporary files end up in your source tree from IDEs and Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems such as CVS and Subversion. To avoid having to always explicitly exclude these, exclude patterns are enabled by default for some common patterns.

Many users have been bitten by the confusion caused when a fileset omits files because they match one of these **default exclude patterns**. The `<fileset>` element has a `defaultexcludes` attribute for turning off this behavior. Simply use `defaultexcludes="no"` to turn off the automatic exclusions.

If needed, you can change the set of `defaultexcludes` files using the `<defaultexcludes>` task.

You can add files:

```xml
<defaultexcludes add="**/*.iml"/>
```

You can remove a pattern:

```xml
<defaultexcludes remove="**/.svn"/>
```

You can reset the set of patterns:

```xml
<defaultexcludes default="true"/>
```

And you can even print the list of current patterns:

```xml
<defaultexcludes echo="true"/>
```

File: `echo-default-exclude.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project name="HelloWorld" default="echo" basedir=".">
    <target name="echo">
        <defaultexcludes echo="true"/>
    </target>
</project>
```

Output:

```bash
$ ant -f echo-default-exclude.xml 
Buildfile: echo-default-exclude.xml

echo:
[defaultexcludes] Current Default Excludes:%n  **/%*%
[defaultexcludes]   **/.git/**
[defaultexcludes]   **/SCCS
[defaultexcludes]   **/.bzr

[defaultexcludes]   **/.hgsub
[defaultexcludes]   **/.DS_Store
[defaultexcludes]   **/.cvsignore

We recommend extending only the list, and only then if your SCM system or editor creates different file types to exclude. If you get the list wrong, you can end up excluding all files!
