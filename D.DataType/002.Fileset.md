我总结Fileset的三个特点：

- （1） 集合：Fileset是一个文件(File)的集合(Set)，它包含了一组文件。
- （2） 无序：它是一个集合，也意味着里面的元素是“无序”的
- （3） 过滤：可能通过某种过滤方式来取集合中的一部分元素，就是通过PatternSet和Selector。PatternSet是通过文件的路径名来进行过滤，而Selector是通过其他的方面进行过滤，例如文件的时间、存储空间的大小等方面。

A FileSet is a group of files. These files can be found in a directory tree starting in a base directory and are matched by patterns taken from a number of **PatternSets** and **Selectors**.

All rules must be satisfied before a file is considered part of a `fileset`, so when using **selectors** in conjunction with **patternsets**, the file must match the `include` patterns, must not match any `exclude` patterns, and the **selector** rules must test positively. If you don’t find the current selectors adequate, you can write a custom one in Java.

**By default**, a `fileset` specified with only a root directory will include **all the files in that entire directory tree**, including files in all subdirectories recursively.

Let’s copy files from one directory to another:

```xml
<copy todir="newweb">
    <fileset dir="web"/>
</copy>
```

In its current form, all files from the `web` directory are copied to the `newweb` directory.

## 1. attribute

- `dir`: the root of the directory tree of this FileSet.
- `includes`: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be included.
- `excludes`: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be excluded.
- `casesensitive`: Must the include and exclude patterns be treated in a case sensitive way?

### 1.1. dir

### 1.2. includes

### 1.3. excludes

## 2. nested element

Groups all files in directory `${server.src}` that are Java source files and don't have the text `Test` in their name.

```xml
<fileset dir="${server.src}" casesensitive="yes">
  <include name="**/*.java"/>
  <exclude name="**/*Test*"/>
</fileset>
```

## 3. fileset resolution

Another thing to know is that **`filesets` resolve their files when the declaration is first evaluated**. This may not be when it’s declared, but when it’s first used. **Once resolved, the set is never updated**. This is important to know when referring to a previously defined fileset, as new files and directories matching the patterns may have appeared between the resolution and reference; these new files do not appear in the fileset.
